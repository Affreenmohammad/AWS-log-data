# AWS-log-data
Here, we analyze the log data in AWS platform by using services like EMR, S3. 
In this project, we launch a fully functional hadoop cluster to analyze the log data.
By using amazon EMR, we launch a cluster by specifying the qualities of cluster we need.
By using Hive-QL, we define schema and create a table to process the log data.
Analyze the data using Hive-QL and write results to amazon S3 output bucket.
The output file contains the log data from cloudfront.
